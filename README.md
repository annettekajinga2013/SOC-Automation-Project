# SOC Automation Project

## Objective

The SOC Automation Project was designed to build a simulated environment for automating the detection and response to cyber threats. The focus was on integrating telemetry and log data into a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, leveraging automation to simulate, detect, and respond to attack scenarios. This hands-on experience enhanced understanding of modern SOC operations, incident response workflows, and automation in cybersecurity.

### Skills Learned

-In-depth knowledge of SIEM integration and automated alerting workflows.

-Proficiency in interpreting and correlating network and host-based logs.

-Familiarity with attack simulation and detection through automated rule sets.

-Hands-on experience with security orchestration and automation tools.

-Strengthened analytical thinking and cybersecurity incident handling.

### Tools Used

-SIEM Platforms (e.g., Splunk, Elastic SIEM) for centralized log analysis and correlation.

-Automation Tools (e.g., SOAR platforms, custom Python scripts) for alert enrichment and response.

-Telemetry Generators (e.g., Atomic Red Team, Caldera) to simulate attack behaviors.

-Network Analysis Tools (e.g., Wireshark) for traffic inspection and validation.
